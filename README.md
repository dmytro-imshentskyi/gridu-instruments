Hello! This is my test project for boosting knowledge and show my experience in BigData and Spark API.

All sub-tasks have been completed with using DataFrame API.
Project contains 2 files:
  - gridu.package contains domain class Instrument
  - Demo is a driver program

Tests are presented by gridu.InstrumentCsvSpec. Just launch it and enjoy power of TDD.

To kick off Spark application, please import project as SBT file and run Demo.scala. Result will be printed in the console.
